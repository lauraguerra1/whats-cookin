# What's Cookin'? 

## Abstract: 
This is a recipe website that displays information about recipes, allows searching by name, ingredients, tags, and allows users to save their favorite recipes! This is a collaborative project that was created to strengthen skills in collaboration and put to use newly learned concepts such as Rest APIs and use of array prototype methods to perform data manipulation. 

- This web application chooses a user at random, which are fetched from an API endpoint. 
- Recipe and ingredient information is also fetched from an API endpoint. 
- All recipes are displayed and can be clicked on to view more information including cooking directions, ingredients and total cost to make the recipe.
- Testing was implemented with the Mocha framework and Chai library.

## Learning Goals:
- Use object and array prototype methods to perform data manipulation
- Create a user interface that is easy to use and clearly displays information.
- Write DRY, reusable code that follows SRP and trends toward function purity
- Implement a robust testing suite using TDD
- Make network requests to retrieve data
- Collaborate productively and professionally as a team. Ensure all team members are able to be heard and contribute throughout the project.
